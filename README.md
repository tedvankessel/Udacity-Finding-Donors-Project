## Rubric item: Exploring the Data
### Data Exploration
> Implementation correctly calculates the following:

    Number of records
    Number of individuals with income >$50,000
    Number of individuals with income <=$50,000
    Percentage of individuals with income > $50,000

## Rubric item: Preparing the Data
> ### Data Preprocessing
    Correctly implements one-hot encoding for the feature and income data.

## Rubric item: Evaluating Model Performance
> ### Question 1: Naive Predictor Performance
    Student correctly calculates the benchmark score of the naive predictor for both accuracy and F1 scores.

> ### Question 2: Model Application
    The pros and cons or application for each model is provided with reasonable 
    justification why each model was chosen to be explored.
    Please list all the references you use while listing out your pros and cons.

> ### Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline
    Student successfully implements a pipeline in code that will train and predict on 
    the supervised learning algorithm given.

> ### Initial Model Evaluation
    Student correctly implements three supervised learning models and produces 
    a performance visualization.




> ### Question 3:
Choosing the Best Model
	
    Justification is provided for which model appears to be the best to use given computational cost, model performance, and the characteristics of the data.
