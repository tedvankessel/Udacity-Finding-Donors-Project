    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    ">The Random Forest Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm that falls under the category of ensemble methods. It's a supervised learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and makes independent predictions. The final prediction in a Random Forest is typically a majority vote (for classification) or an average (for regression) of the predictions from individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significant Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Classification: Random Forest is widely used for classification tasks, such as identifying whether a person's income is above or below a certain threshold based on features like age, education, occupation, etc.\n",
    "Feature Importance: Random Forest can be used to determine the importance of different features in making predictions, which can be valuable for feature selection and understanding the data.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection: It can be used for anomaly detection by identifying instances that deviate significantly from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    ">High Accuracy: Random Forest is known for its high accuracy due to the averaging effect of multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting.\n",
    "Robustness: It handles noisy and missing data well, making it suitable for real-world datasets.\n",
    "Feature Importance: It provides a measure of feature importance, helping in understanding which features contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "Scaling: It works well with both numerical and categorical features without requiring extensive data preprocessing.\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: The randomness introduced in the algorithm helps prevent overfitting to a great extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Complexity: The model can become complex with a large number of trees, which might lead to longer training times and increased memory usage.\n",
    "Interpretability: While Random Forest provides feature importance, the ensemble nature makes it less interpretable than a single decision tree.\n",
    "Not Ideal for Linear Relationships: If the underlying relationships in the data are primarily linear, other algorithms like logistic regression might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability for the census.csv dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Random Forest Classifier is well-suited for the provided dataset, which includes a mix of numerical and categorical features. Since the data has a combination of both continuous (e.g., age, education-num, capital-gain) and categorical (e.g., workclass, education_level, marital-status) attributes, Random Forest can handle this type of data effectively. It can be used to predict the \"income\" category based on the given features, making it a suitable choice for this classification task.\n",

    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. It belongs to the family of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are effective for finding the optimal decision boundary that maximizes the margin between different classes in the feature space. In the case of SVC, this decision boundary is a hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significant Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Binary Classification: SVC is commonly used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to separate data points into two classes, such as whether an individual's income is above or below a certain threshold.\n",
    "Text Classification: SVC has been successfully applied to natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis or text categorization.\n",
    "Image Classification: SVC can also be used in image classification scenarios, such as identifying objects in images based on their features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Effective in High-Dimensional Space: SVC performs well in high-dimensional feature spaces, making it suitable for datasets with many features.\n",
    "Robust to Outliers: The algorithm aims to find the optimal margin, which makes it less sensitive to outliers that might affect other algorithms.\n",
    "Memory Efficiency: SVC uses a subset of the training data points called support vectors, which reduces the memory required for model storage and prediction.\n",
    "Flexibility: The choice of kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function) allows SVC to handle complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Limited to Binary Classification: SVC is primarily designed for binary classification tasks. While it can be extended to multiclass problems, it requires more complex strategies (e.g., one-vs-one or one-vs-rest) for handling multiple classes.\n",
    "Sensitivity to Hyperparameters: The performance of SVC can be sensitive to the choice of kernel, regularization parameter, and other hyperparameters. Tuning these hyperparameters is crucial for optimal results.\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: For large datasets, especially with non-linear kernels, the training time and prediction can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "Interpretability: The decision boundary produced by an SVC can be challenging to interpret compared to simpler linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability for the census.csv dataset:\n",
    ">SVC can be suitable for the given dataset, but it might require preprocessing to handle the categorical features properly (e.g., one-hot encoding). Since the data appears to be a binary classification task, with the goal of predicting whether an individual's income is above or below a certain threshold, an SVC can be applied. However, it's important to handle the categorical variables appropriately and to tune the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Significant Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Image Classification: KNN can be used for image classification tasks where the input data consists of images represented as feature vectors.\n",
    "Recommendation Systems: KNN can be applied to build recommendation systems based on user preferences and similarities with other users.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection: KNN can be useful for detecting anomalies or outliers in datasets by identifying instances that are significantly different from their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Simple to Understand: KNN is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for quick prototyping and as a baseline model.\n",
    "No Assumptions: KNN makes minimal assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it suitable for a wide range of problems.\n",
    "Adaptable to Different Data Types: KNN can be used with both numerical and categorical data, as well as mixed data types.\n",
    "Non-linear Decision Boundaries: KNN can capture complex decision boundaries, especially when the dataset is sufficiently large.\n",
    "Suitable for Multiclass Problems: KNN can handle multiclass classification naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Computationally Intensive: The algorithm's computational complexity increases with the size of the training data, especially during prediction, as it requires calculating distances to all training examples.\n",
    "Sensitive to Feature Scaling: KNN is sensitive to the scale of features, and it's important to preprocess features to ensure meaningful distances.\n",
    "Noisy Data and Outliers: KNN can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers, leading to inaccurate predictions.\n",
    "Curse of Dimensionality: KNN's performance can degrade in high-dimensional feature spaces, where the concept of \"neighborhood\" becomes less meaningful.\n",
    "Optimal 'k' Selection: Choosing the right value of 'k' (number of neighbors) can impact the performance. Too small 'k' may lead to overfitting, and too large 'k' may lead to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability for the census.csv dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    ">KNN can be suitable for the given dataset, which has both numerical and categorical features. However, it's important to preprocess the data, handle categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding), and scale the features appropriately. Since the dataset is not very large, the computational intensity might not be a significant issue. KNN can work well if the relationships between features and income are not overly complex. Experimenting with different values of 'k' and evaluating the model's performance would be important to determine the optimal 'k' for this specific problem.\n",

    ">The price for this is slightly longer classification times due to the need to evaluate all those decision trees. In practice I find (including this project - see above) this time compares well to other methods. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Random forest is an ensemble method in that the results of many decision trees are combined to generate a prediction. This property makes random forest resistant to overfitting the data. \n"
